## Computing Majors & Specializations

### Majors

* ACM's Computing Disciplines and Majors
  - [Computer Science](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=8): Currently the most popular of the computing disciplines; tends to be relatively broad and with an emphasis on the underlying science aspects.
  - [Computer Engineering](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=11): Typically involves software and hardware and the development of systems that involve software, hardware, and communications.
  - [Information Systems](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=9): Essentially, this is computing in an organizational context, typically in businesses.
  - [Information Technology](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=7): Focuses on computing infrastructure and needs of individual users; tends to involve a study of systems (perhaps just software systems, but perhaps also systems in support of learning, of information dissemination, etc.).
  - [Software Engineering](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12): Focuses on large-scale software systems; employs certain ideas from the world of engineering in building reliable software systems.
  - [Mixed Disciplinary Majors](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=10): Because computing is such an important and dynamic field, many interdisciplinary majors, some very recent developments, exist at some schools.
* [UW CS Course Pathways](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/courses/course-pathways): CSE is an ever-growing field, and a CSE degree provides an amazing breadth of opportunities. It may be unclear which courses are particularly relevant for some of the more common job titles or career paths you may be considering. This page is designed to be a starting point in directing you toward specific employment specializations.

### Bachelors, Masters, PhD

## Software Engineering Roles

* Software Development Engineer (SDE), sometimes also called Software Developer, Programmer, and others. [Titles for developers vary widely.](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/05/26/job-titles/)
* Technical Program Manager (TPM)
* Software Development Manager (SDM)
* Support Engineer
